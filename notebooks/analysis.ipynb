    "\n",
    "This is an analysis of an A/B test conducted on the mobile game Cookie Cats. The game uses 'gates' that force players to wait a certain time before progressing. The objective is to determine if moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 has a significant impact on player retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core question: **Which gate placement drives better long-term player engagement?** We will analyze 1-day and 7-day retention as our key metrics."

A lower 7-day retention rate will almost certainly lead to lower overall player lifetime value.\n",
